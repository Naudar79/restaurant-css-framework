But how did we do it ? : 
========================


After carefully reading the instructions given by our coach Arnaud, we answered these few questions:

 - What type of restaurant do we want?
 - What will be his identity? its name, logo, slogan, ...

 From there, we proceeded to the:

 - logo creation
 - establishment of the graphic charter
 -  distribution in the group of the different pages to be created.

Before starting our html writing, we established a page canvas, with for each, *the same header and footer.*
That we have shared so that we can start to fill our pages individually.
Once the html was written, we moved on to Bootstrap and Sass.
*In order to organize and style our page.*

Description of pages:
=====================
