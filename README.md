So for the restaurant page: I had to put the different addresses of your restaurant, 
add a map of the main restaurant and put the schedules of the restaurants of the other cities. 

For the map I use: 

- Bootsnipp : https://bootsnipp.com/tags/maps?page=2
- Open Street Map: https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=https%3A%2F%2Fg.page%2FBeCode-Charleroi%3Fshare#map=8/50.512/5.438
to have the html code.

For the icons I use: 
- Bootstrap Icons: https://icons.getbootstrap.com/

Unfortunately, I couldn't use the responsive because I couldn't find the problem in my code so I hope that 
I'll get some help to fix this and better understand how to use the responsive.

## Creation of the home page
  Chic kebab index page(Abu)
  The home page was built on a common template consisting of a navigation and footer put to gather by my college (Olivier).
  In creating the creating the home page I added a head section to the header and divided the main page into two sections, class section1 and class section2. 
  The head section 
  The head section contains an h1 welcoming message and an animated background 
  Class sections 
  Both sections uses the bootsrap grid layout.
  Class section1  
  this section has a row and two columns, both occupying a space of 45% of that of the parent section, and the remaining space spread around them. the first column contains an image and the second a box shadowed jumbotron with a covid guidance notice.
   
  Class section2 
   It contains three rows. The first row is made up of a column with a size of 12 on all screens. This column is attributed an image and an h4 title. The other two  rows  contains two equal size columns each. The size of each column is 6 on larger screens and 12 on smaller screen (for stacking effect).
  Finally each column contain an image and a caption encapsulated in a figure tag.
