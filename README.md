## Creation of the home page
  Chic kebab index page(Abu)
  The home page was built on a common template consisting of a navigation and footer put to gather by my college (Olivier).
  In creating the creating the home page I added a head section to the header and divided the main page into two sections, class section1 and class section2. 
  The head section 
  The head section contains an h1 welcoming message and an animated background 
  Class section 1
  This section is displayed in flex with a flex wrap property to render it responsive and contains two articles (article1 and two) both box shadowed and displayed in an inline-block with a border radius of 20   pixels. The first article contains a centred h4 header and a padded paragraph while that of the second contains an image 
  Class section2 
  This section uses a bootstrap grid layout. It contains three rows. The first row is made up of a column with a size of 12 on all screens. This column is attributed an image and an h4 title. The other two  rows  contains two equal size columns each. The size of each column is 6 on larger screens and 12 on smaller screen (for stacking effect).
  Finally each column contain an image and a caption encapsulated in a figure tag.
