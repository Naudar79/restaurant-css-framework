# restaurant-css-framework

So for the restaurant page: I had to put the different addresses of your restaurant, 
add a map of the main restaurant and put the schedules of the restaurants of the other cities. 

For the map I use: 

- Bootsnipp : https://bootsnipp.com/tags/maps?page=2
- Open Street Map: https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=https%3A%2F%2Fg.page%2FBeCode-Charleroi%3Fshare#map=8/50.512/5.438
to have the html code.

For the icons I use: 
- Bootstrap Icons: https://icons.getbootstrap.com/

Unfortunately, I couldn't use the responsive because I couldn't find the problem in my code so I hope that 
I'll get some help to fix this and better understand how to use the responsive.
